# Time-Evolution-of-the-Wavefunction
Time evolution of the Gaussian wave by Schr√∂dinger's Picture in Quantum Mechanics

Ignore the file dum.py and download the two python codes. 

Run one file at a time in Linux or in Mac as ~$ python Wave_Evolution.py or ~$ python Wave_Evolution-Setter_Getter.py.
Both file will produce identical result. 

The animation produced by the python file is demonstration of time evolution of Gaussian Wavefunction by using 
Cranck-Nicholson algorithm.
