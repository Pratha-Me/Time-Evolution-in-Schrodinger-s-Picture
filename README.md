# Time Evolution in Schrödinger's Picture
The two python files will produce an animation for the Time evolution of the Gaussian wave by Schrödinger's Picture in Quantum Mechanics. Download the two python codes. 

Run one file at a time in Linux or in Mac as ~$ python3 Wave_Evolution.py or ~$ python3 Wave_Evolution-Setter_Getter.py.

The animation produced by the python file is a demonstration of time evolution of Gaussian Wavefunction by using 
Cranck-Nicholson algorithm. The system comprises a positive Potential well and 1-D box inside which am energetic particle is trapped.
